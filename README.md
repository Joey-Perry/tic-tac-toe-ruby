<h1><strong>Assignment</strong></h1>
<p>Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players 
can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.</p>

<p>Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦What should be a class? 
Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.</p>

<p>Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.<p>

<h2> Problem Solving Steps </h2>

<ol>
<li>Does the program have a user interface? : The game will be run from the command line.</li>
<li> What inputs will the program have? : Two users who will each provide numbers which correspond to the placement of their tokens on the tic tac toe board. </li>
<li> What's the desired output? : The desired output is a declaration of a winner between the two players or in the event of a tie, the declaration of a tie. </li>
<li> Given the inputs, what are the steps necessary to return the desired output? : 
    <ul>
    <li>Each user selection will need to be stored and their choices compared against the winning combinations. </li>
    <li>The number of available spaces on the board will need to be monitored so that 
    when the board is full the game is marked as a tie.</li>
    </ul>
